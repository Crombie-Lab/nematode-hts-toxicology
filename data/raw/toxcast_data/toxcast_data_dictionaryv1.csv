hitc,"Hit-/activity-call, generally a continuous value from 0 to 1 if usingÊtcplFit2Êfitting"
modl,Winning model
fitc,Fit category

a,"fitting parameter methods: exp2, exp3, poly1, poly2, pow"
er,fitted error term for plotting error bars
bmr,benchmark response; level at which bmd is calculated = onesd*bmr_scale default bmr_scale is 1.349
bmdl,"lower limit on the bmd (benchmark dose, curve value at bmr)"
